SFU gitLab in assignment



Development models:

Waterfall model : Use it when requirements are clear from the begining.

Glass's Law : Requirement deficiencies are prime souce of project faliures.

SFU GitLab setup
https://coursys.sfu.ca/2020su-cmpt-470-e1/pages/GitLab

git commands:

most git commands : $git <verb> <options> <path>

$git add : stage new and modified files in current directory
$git add -A : stage all changes (new, added, deleted files) in entire repository
$git add -u : stage modifications/deletions in already tracked files
$git rm <file> : remove file from working directory & stage this change
$git commit -m <message> : Commit Changes (to local repo)
$git push : Push changes (to remote repo)
$git pull: Pull changes (from remote repo)

Configure git:

file .gitconfig in your home directory contains user-specific settings
you can edit these to set your email, preferred editor, etc.
project-specific settings are in .git/config

$git config <key> : to view settings (e.g., git config user.name)
$git config <key> <value> : view settings (e.g., git config user.name Saba)
examples: set global configuration
$git config --global user.name “Saba Alimadadi"
$git config --global user.email “saba@sfu.ca”
$git config —list : view all settings
$git config <level> —list, where <level> is one of: --system (system-wide); —
global (global to the user); nothing: (1p3roject level)

.gitignore

create file .gitignore in top-level directory
contains entries like *.log, dir/*.temp
files matching these patterns will not be versioncontrolled
there are templates on git for many programming languages/operating systems/frameworks/IDEs/etc

Branches

A branch is string of commits
each commit identified by a 40 digit hex number
default branch is called “master”*
most recent commit on a branch is called HEAD

Branching lets you diverge from the main line of development:
enables concurrent development, working per-feature
exploration of ideas

❖ Branches are fast, cheap, and easy. You should use branching
extensively.

$git branch : show list of branches
$git branch <name> : create new branch
$git checkout <name> : switch to branch*
$git diff <branch1> <branch2> : show the differences between two branches
$git merge <branch> : merge <branch> into current branches

Merging branches

best practices:
	❖ start with a clean working directory
	❖ keep commits small
	❖ merge often
if git detects a merge conflict, it will:
	❖ display a warning message
	❖ leave the conflicting information the affected file(s)
you have two options:
	❖ 1. abort the merge: git merge —abort
	❖ 2. resolve the conflict by:
		❖ editing the files with conflicting changes
		❖ stage the changes
		❖ commit

Undo changes:
$git commit --amend : amend the last commit to reflect current working dir
$git checkout <file> : restore file that is/was in working directory from repo
$git reset HEAD <file> : unstage changes to <file>
$git revert <commit> : new commit that reverses the effects of <commit>

Changing Head:
$git reset --reset-type <commit> : Points HEAD to a previous commit. Any new commits
will be from that point. The “later” commits will be lost.
BE CAREFUL USING THIS COMMAND.

Working with remote repos:

❖ A typical project strategy is to make a central host the “origin” for the project.

❖ Team members:
	❖ clone the remote repository
	❖ do work in a personal environment, synchronizing with the origin as
	appropriate
	❖ propose updates to the origin
	❖ accept or reject these updates (a role usually reserved for a special few or at
	least not the proposer). Accepted changes are merged into the origin
❖ Example hosts:
	❖ https://github.com/
	❖ https://bitbucket.org/
	❖ We will use SFU CS’s GitLab server: https://csil-git1.cs.surrey.sfu.ca/

Synchronizing with remotes

$git pull : fetch state of HEAD on remote and merge it locally
$git fetch : fetch state of HEAD on remote, but do not merge
$git push : push state of HEAD on current branch to remote
$git push <remote> <branch> : push state of HEAD on <branch> to <remote>

Repo for the group project:

❖ A group repository will be created for each group
❖ This is were you will keep and track all your homework and project deliverables
❖ Please contact the TAs if you don’t receive an invitation
